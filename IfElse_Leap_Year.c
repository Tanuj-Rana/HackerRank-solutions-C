/*
A year is considered a leap year if:

It is divisible by 4.
However, if it is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be considered a leap year.
Write a program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not, outputs the result in a specific format, and handles invalid years as well.

Input Format

A single integer Y representing the year.
Constraints

−10^5 ≤ Y ≤ 10^5

Output Format

Print "The given year [Y] is Invalid year." if the year is invalid.
Print "Yes, [Y] is a leap year." if the year is a leap year.
Print "No, [Y] is not a leap year." otherwise.*/

int main() {
     int Y;
     scanf("%d",&Y);
     if(Y<0){
         printf("The given year %d is Invalid year.",Y);
     }
    else if(Y%400 == 0)
    {
       printf("Yes, %d is a leap year.",Y);
    }
    else if(Y%100 == 0)
    {
       printf("No, %d is not a leap year.",Y);
    }
     else if(Y%4==0)
     {
       printf("Yes, %d is a leap year.",Y);
